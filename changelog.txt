Refactoring code, tested on latest TextGenUI with update_wizard completed. 

removed thinking emotes - doesn't add enough functionally and could break immersion. 
removed goals - will be replaced with a task sub-system and knowlege graphs
removed emotion data table - This has been replaced by taking the sentiment of the last 24 hours of conversation. The bot is usually smart enough to understand the polarity score in the prefix. 
Updated ego thinking statement to add in q/a pairs
removed the linux docker - will implement this in the agent subsystem later.

20240629 - General code cleanup. Added .gitignore under storage. Updated README.md ToC.

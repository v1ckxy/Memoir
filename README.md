![Image of an android writing in a journal with futuristic city out of window: Generated by Dalle](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/brucepro/Memoir/main/images/ai_gen_memoir.jpg)

Important: I recommend you go to the qdrant dashboard: <http://localhost:6333/dashboard> and create and download a snapshot of your agents vector store. This will allow you to restore in case something happens where the docker zaps it. Next release has a few features to fix this, but good to have the backup.

## Introduction

Memoir is an AI-powered plugin designed to enrich your existing AI companions within the Text Generation Web UI. With advanced memory capabilities and emotional intelligence, Memoir transforms your interactions with AI into a more nuanced and human-like experience.
